 @endverbatim

@par Example Description:

This example shows how to use the ADC discontinuous mode trigged by EXTI channel.
- The KEY1 is connected to EXTI channel used to trigger ADC.
- The ADCLK frequency is set to CK_AHB / 64.
- Three ADC channel are configured as ADC input.

The ADC is configured as discontinuous mode. The sequence length is 3 and subgroup length is 2.

The subgroup 0 includes:
- Sequence 0 used to convert Channel n1. The conversion time = (1/(CK_AHB / 64)) * 14.
- Sequence 1 used to convert Channel n2. The conversion time = (1/(CK_AHB / 64)) * 14.

The subgroup 1 includes:
- Sequence 2 used to convert Channel n3. The conversion time = (1/(CK_AHB / 64)) * 14.

The cycle and subgroup EOC(end of conversion) interrupt is enabled. The ADC interrupt service routine will
store ADC result into the global variable gADC_Result. The subgroup length is 2. So every 2 ADC single EOC
occur a subgroup EOC interrupt. Because sequence length is 3 and subgroup length is 2, the last subgroup
length is 1 (3 mod 2 = 1). When the last subgroup is finished, both cycle and subgroup EOC flag are set. So
this program use cycle EOC to distinguish the last subgroup.

If the USART is connected to PC, the transformed data will be printed on Hyperterminal.

@par Hardware and Software Environment:

- Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the COM1 DB9 connector and PC serial port.
  HyperTerminal configuration:
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - BaudRate = 115200 baud
  - flow control: None
- This example can be run on HT32 Series development board.
