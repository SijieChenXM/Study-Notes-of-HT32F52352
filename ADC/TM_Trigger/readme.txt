@par Example Description:

This example shows how to trigger ADC by GPTM0 compare match of CH3 (CH3O).
- The GPTM0 CH3O is configured to trigger the ADC.
- The frequency is 1 Hz and the duty is 50%. ADC will be trigger every 1 second.
- The ADCLK frequency is set to CK_AHB / 64.
- The conversion time = (1/(CK_AHB / 64)) * (12.5 + 1.5 + 36).
- The ADC is configured as one shot mode and the sequence length is 3.

The cycle end of conversion interrupt is enabled. Each time the ADC cycle conversion is finished (Three
Channels are finished), a cycle end of conversion interrupt will occur. The ADC interrupt service routine will
store the ADC result into the global variable, gADC_Result.

If the USART is connected to PC, the transformed data will be printed on Hyperterminal. Besides, LED1 ~ LED3
represent to GPTM0 CH3 compare match (trigger), single end of conversion, and cycle end of conversion.

@par Hardware and Software Environment:

- Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the COM1 DB9 connector and PC serial port.
  HyperTerminal configuration:
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - BaudRate = 115200 baud
  - flow control: None
- This example can be run on HT32 Series development board.
