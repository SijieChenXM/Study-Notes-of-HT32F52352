 @endverbatim

@par Example Description:

This example shows how to use the ADC continuous mode to measure the potentiometer level.

The ADCLK frequency is set to CK_AHB / 64. Conversion time = (1/(CK_AHB / 64)) * 14.
The ADC channel n is configured as ADC input.

The ADC is configured as continuous mode and the single end of conversion interrupt is enabled.
Therefore, the ADC will continuously convert ADC input.
Each time the ADC conversion is finished, a single end of conversion interrupt will occur.
The ADC interrupt service routine will transform the ADC result to percentage format
and store into the global variable gPotentiometerLevel.

If the USART is connected to PC, the transformed data will be printed on Hyperterminal.

- ADC/Potentiometer_ContinuousMode/ht32fxxxx_it.c         Interrupt handlers

@par Hardware and Software Environment:

- Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the COM1 DB9 connector and PC serial port.
  HyperTerminal configuration:
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - BaudRate = 115200 baud
  - flow control: None
- This example can be run on HT32 Series development board.
